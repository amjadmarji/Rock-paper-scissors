## About The Game
The game has two players. In a single round of the game, each player secretly chooses one of three moves, or "throws" â€” rock, paper, or scissors. Then, players reveal their moves at the same time. If both players picked the same move, there is no winner. Otherwise, rock beats scissors; paper beats rock; and scissors beat paper.
